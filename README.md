Basic Medical Queries:
Responding to common questions about symptoms, first aid, treatments, and general health information.EDICAL-RULE-BASED-CHATBOT** project is a simple rule-based chatbot designed to provide basic medical information and answer common health-related questions. This README provides an overview of the project, including its features, usage instructions, and examples.

### Project Overview

The **BASIC-MEDICAL-RULE-BASED-CHATBOT** aims to assist users with basic medical inquiries by responding to predefined questions and providing relevant information based on a set of rules. This chatbot operates on a deterministic rule-based system and does not incorporate machine learning or natural language understanding.

### Key Features and Functionality

- **Rule-Based Responses**:
  - Provides responses based on predefined rules and patterns, enabling the chatbot to answer specific questions related to common medical topics.

- **Basic Medical Information**:
  - Covers general health inquiries, symptoms, first aid advice, and other common medical queries.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Interacts with users in a text-based chat interface, processing user inputs and generating appropriate responses.

### Prerequisites

Before running the chatbot, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.x recommended)

### Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-medical-rule-based-chatbot.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd basic-medical-rule-based-chatbot
   ```

3. **Run the Chatbot**:

   Execute the `chatbot.py` script to start the chatbot:

   ```bash
   python chatbot.py
   ```

4. **Interact with the Chatbot**:

   Once the chatbot is running, interact with it by typing your medical questions or inquiries into the command-line interface.

### Project Structure

- **`Rule based chatbots.ipynb`**:
  - Main script that implements the rule-based chatbot.
  - Defines rules for processing user inputs and generating appropriate responses.
